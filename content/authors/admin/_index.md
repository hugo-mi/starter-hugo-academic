Recently graduated from the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT) as a data engineer, I chose to continue my studies in the field of Big Data by integrating the Specialized Master Big Data provided by Telecom Paris. 

My years of study have allowed to expand my skills in order to transform raw data into usable information, while developing a critical mind towards the techniques used

My scientific background has allowed me to develop a logical way of thinking to convert business requirements into data analysis problems, to provide insights from data for decision support, thus building the bridge between the two worlds. In addition to being a full-fledged and passionate scientist, I trust human interactions and feel at ease collaborating within a team both for idea generation and delivery.
